# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of SystemGeneratedAttributes from a JSON string
system_generated_attributes_instance = SystemGeneratedAttributes.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(SystemGeneratedAttributes.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
system_generated_attributes_dict = system_generated_attributes_instance.to_dict()
