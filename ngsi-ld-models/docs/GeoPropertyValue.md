## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.geo_property_value import GeoPropertyValue

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of GeoPropertyValue from a JSON string
geo_property_value_instance = GeoPropertyValue.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(GeoPropertyValue.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
geo_property_value_dict = geo_property_value_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of GeoPropertyValue from a dict
geo_property_value_from_dict = GeoPropertyValue.from_dict(geo_property_value_dict)
