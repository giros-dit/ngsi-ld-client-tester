## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.iot_description import IotDescription

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of IotDescription from a JSON string
iot_description_instance = IotDescription.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(IotDescription.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
iot_description_dict = iot_description_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of IotDescription from a dict
iot_description_from_dict = IotDescription.from_dict(iot_description_dict)
