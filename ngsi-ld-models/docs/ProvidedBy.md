## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.provided_by import ProvidedBy

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ProvidedBy from a JSON string
provided_by_instance = ProvidedBy.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(ProvidedBy.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
provided_by_dict = provided_by_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ProvidedBy from a dict
provided_by_from_dict = ProvidedBy.from_dict(provided_by_dict)
